# ThemeTweaker â€” Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product Overview

ThemeTweaker is a dev-only visual theming tool that enables live editing of CSS tokens, component styles, and variants through an intuitive browser-based UI. It integrates seamlessly with Next.js + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui projects, allowing developers to preview changes instantly without re-renders and export modifications back to the codebase.

The tool solves the problem of tedious manual CSS editing by providing a visual interface for theme customization, targeting developers who need to rapidly prototype and iterate on design systems while maintaining code quality and consistency.
